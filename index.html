        <div class="questions"><h3>What is a sorting algorithm?</h3><h2 class="icon"><i class="fa-solid fa-caret-down"></i></h2></div>
        <div class="answers "><p>A sorting algorithm is a method for arranging or ordering a set of data in a specific sequence. Sorting algorithms are commonly used in computer programming to organize data efficiently and improve search and retrieval times.</p></div>

        <div class="questions"><h3>How does a sorting algorithm work?</h3><h2 class="icon"><i class="fa-solid fa-caret-down"></i></h2></div>
        <div class="answers "><p>A sorting algorithm works by comparing two elements in a list, and swapping their positions based on a specific criterion. This process is repeated until all the elements in the list are arranged in the desired order.</p></div>

        <div class="questions"><h3>What are some common types of sorting algorithms?</h3><h2 class="icon"><i class="fa-solid fa-caret-down"></i></h2></div>
        <div class="answers "><p>Some common types of sorting algorithms include Bubble Sort, Selection Sort, Insertion Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort, and Heap Sort. Each algorithm has its own unique way of comparing and rearranging elements in a list.</p></div>

        <div class="questions"><h3>How can a sorting algorithm be visualized?</h3><h2 class="icon"><i class="fa-solid fa-caret-down"></i></h2></div>
        <div class="answers "><p>A sorting algorithm can be visualized by representing each element in the list as a visual object, such as a colored bar or a circle. As the algorithm compares and swaps elements, the objects can be animated to show their changing positions and relationships to each other.</p></div>

        <div class="questions"><h3>Why is it important to understand sorting algorithms?</h3><h2 class="icon"><i class="fa-solid fa-caret-down"></i></h2></div>
        <div class="answers "><p>Understanding sorting algorithms is important for computer programming, data analysis, and problem-solving in many fields. By knowing the strengths and weaknesses of different sorting algorithms, programmers can choose the most appropriate algorithm for their specific task, and optimize their code for efficiency and speed.</p></div>
